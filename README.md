# sonificationSummerProjectCSIRO
Software backend built to run on Raspberry Pi to Sonifiy Radio Waves During Summer 23/24

## Notes Feb 2nd, Faisal Umar
During my summer studentship I started this module and managed to achieve the core aim
of sonification of radio waves. However a few things remaind incomplete such as the ability
scroll a list of pre-defined frequencies for the user to sonifi for which I have done the
abstraction functions in appStart.py and it will need a mechanism to swap a boolean between
user input and an input from a predefined list of frequencies which also needs to be populated.
My notes from the development of the system initially are present in a word document as well as
a presentation and its script that explain this project which were given during my studentship
if they're also able to provide documentation.
